Im passionate about financial markets and investing. Im also a motivated programmer who likes to apply his skills to solve problems. After spending hours of time developing Excel models manually I decided to build an application to automatically scrape the web for company fundamentals and build Excel models. The application I have developed has saved me hours of time when valueing companies using the dividend discount financial model.
